# Donate

> **Running a Minecraft Server and developing a custom **[**Discord Bot**](https://eviebot.rocks)** costs quite a bit, every dollar counts!**

**TristanSMP** Requires the Communities Help for a **Lag Free** and **Fun** Experience

Every cent of the money goes towards the Minecraft server, as hosting a server costs quite a bit and I can't afford it without the help of our Donators.

So if you want to make a positive difference on the server donate here!
